# surfs_up

## Overview of the statistical analysis: 
The purpose of this project was to become familiar with SQL database structures and querying methods using SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. 

The purpose of the statistical anaylsis was to illustrate temperature trends for June and December in Oahu, Hawaii to determine if a surf and ice cream shop can be sustained year-round.  

## Results: Three key differences in weather between June and December
June Temperatures:

December Temperatures:

* The average (mean) temperatures for June (74.9) is relatively close to the average temperature in December (71.0); they vary by only by about 4 degrees.
* The minimum temperature for June (64.0 degrees) is 8 degrees higher than the minimum temperature for December (56.0 degrees)
* The maximum temperature for June (85.0 derees) is only 2 degrees higher than the maximum temperature for December (83.0 degrees)

## Summary:
The results of this analysis indicate the temperature is realtively stable throughout the year. The average and maximum temperatures for June and December are quite close. The most variance occurs between the minimum temperatures of the two months. 

We could perform two additional queries to determine more precise temperature readings as well as precipitation measurements from stations closest to the location of the business.
